initialization
==============

First you need a file where your users and group are defined in.  Therefore
you need a +.users+ file which is gpg clear signed.  For security reasons the
fingerpint (+gpg --with-colons --fingerprint keyid+) signer needs to be listed
in +~/.pws-trusted-users+.

---------------------------------
# cat ~/.pws-trusted-users

#formorer
6E3966C1E1D15DB973D05B491E45F8CA9DE23B16
---------------------------------

--------------------------------
cat .users

# This file needs to be gpg signed by a key whose fingerprint
# is listed in ~/.pws-trusted-users

formorer   = 6E3966C1E1D15DB973D05B491E45F8CA9DE23B16
@grml      = formorer

# gpg --clear .users && mv .users.asc .users
--------------------------------

adding a new file
=================

-----------------------------
# pws ed -n file
-----------------------------

editing files
=============

Every file needs a header like:

------------------------------
# gpg < file | head -n2
access: @all
------------------------------

You can edit the encrypted file with the pws tool: +pwd ed file+.

updating the keyring
====================

pws uses its own keyring use +pws update-keyring+ to update the internal
keyring.
